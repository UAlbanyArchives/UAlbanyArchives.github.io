- Allows for testing	
	- New feature on website gets tested

##Terminology a Glance Part 1
- Create repositories or "repos"
	- website, code, documents, etc
- Users can "clone" or download that repo
- Add files to a staging area
- Commit files to the repo
- Push changes to the repo
- Repo owners can invite

##Terminology a Glance Part 2
- "repos" can be "branched" or "forked"
- Branching allows repos to be worked on simultaneously 
	- Once changes are agreed on, the branch can be "merged"
- If repo diverges enough, it is forked into a new repo
